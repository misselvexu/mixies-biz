# Tycho OpenSearch

The OpenSearch framework of Tycho is used to provide a single search field which can be used
to access all relevant data objects in the system.

Therefore, applications and other frameworks are encouraged to implement a [OpneSearchProvider](OpenSearchProvider.java)
to participate in the search process.
